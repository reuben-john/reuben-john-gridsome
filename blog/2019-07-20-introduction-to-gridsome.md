> My move to Houston warrented a site redesign. I've set up a new portfolio and blog built using Vue.js and Gridsome.

### Why Houston?

Relocating to Houston was an opportunity to create a brand new life for my family.

### Why Gridsome?

I built a eBay shipping damage tracking web app in Vue.js and fell in love with how the framework. It was a lot of fun to put together a fully interactive website without having lots of technical debt added.

Gridsome is a static site generator built on top of Vue.js. This made it the perfect fit for a new endeavor.

### What's next?

Blog entries will be mostly documenting things I spend time on in the development world.

#### Possible topics include

- Roguelike creation using C#
- Side projects to flesh out my portfolio
- Vue powered android app I am designing
